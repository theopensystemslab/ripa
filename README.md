# Reducing Invalid Planning Applications

An open, collaborative R&D project funded by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Governmentâ€™s Local Digital Fund to explore and develop 21st century digital services across Local Government. The outputs of this project will be openly shared, in such a way that they can be easily adapted and adopted by any local authority or private sector company wishing to provide a digital planning submissions service.
